Because of their literal interpretation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. They can't read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake their heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished.</p><p>Although they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren't mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that doesn't work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Habitual Behaviors.</span></span> <p>Independent skeletons temporarily or permanently free of a master's control sometimes pantomime actions from their past lives, their bones echoing the rote behaviors of their former living selves. The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can't eat. Left alone in a ballroom, the skeletons of nobles might continue an eternally unfinished dance.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>When skeletons encounter living creatures, the necromantic energy that drives them compels them to kill unless they are commanded by their masters to refrain from doing so. They attack without mercy and fight until destroyed, for skeletons possess little sense of self and even less sense of self-preservation.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Undead Nature.</span></span> <p>A skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"lawful evil","race":"","type":{"value":"undead","subtype":"","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Urban","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM","class":{},"gender":"","age":"","height":"","weight":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":"","notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":["bludgeoning"],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["exhaustion","poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"understands all languages it spoke in life but can't speak"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Skeleton","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"wall-height":{"tokenHeight":0},"tagger":{"tags":""},"image-hover":{"hideArt":false},"token-hud-wildcard":{"default":""}},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"Grim%20Hollow/NPC%27s/skeleton%20token.png","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":60,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":1662398515389,"modifiedTime":1662398515389,"lastModifiedBy":"cvsSJX6vcoBwcF3Q"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cvsSJX6vcoBwcF3Q":3}}

Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door.

Researchers have observed rats completing complex mazes, solving lever-action puzzles, and understanding the world around them to a degree unseen in other animals. A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself. Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur. Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth. Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten
