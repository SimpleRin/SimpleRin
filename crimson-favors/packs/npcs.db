A gang of goblins emerges from the brush, arrows trained on him, their smiles wide at their good fortune of finding such easy prey for the legion's slave pens. Their smiles turn to shrieks of terror as the traveler grows to giant size and leaps at them, his staff now a deadly cudgel.</p><p>The militia forms in ranks to prepare for the orcs' charge. The growling brutes howl their battle cries and surge forward. To their surprise, the human rabble holds its ground and fights with surprising ferocity. Suddenly, mindless fear clings to the orcs' minds and they, despite facing a far inferior foe, turn and run, never noticing the calm half-elf standing amid the militia and directing its efforts.</p><p>Baron von Ludwig was always proud of his grand library. Little did he know that each evening, a gnome laden with blank scrolls slipped past his guards each night and dutifully copied his most heavily guarded archives. When the duke's men arrived to arrest him for dealing with demons, he never guessed that the gnome scribe traveling with them had spent more time in his keep than he had over the past year.</p><p>These heroes are all mystics, followers of a strange and mysterious form of power. Mystics shun the world to turn their eyes inward, mastering the full potential of their minds and exploring their psyches before turning to face the world. Mystics are incredibly rare, and most prefer to keep the nature of their abilities secret. Using their inner, psychic strength, they can read minds, fade into invisibility, transform their bodies into living iron, and seize control of the physical world and bend it to their will.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"9\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hermits and Outcasts</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Mystics are loners. Most discover the secrets of their power through vague references in tomes of lore or by ingratiating themselves to a master of the power.</p><p>In order to master their power, mystics must first master themselves. They spend months and years in quiet contemplation, exploring their minds and leaving nothing uncovered. During this time, they shun society and typically live as hermits at the edge of society. A mystic who studied under a master worked as a virtual slave, toiling away at mundane tasks in return for the occasional lesson or cryptic insight.</p><p>When mystics finally master their power, they return to the world to broaden their horizons and practice their craft.

These quirks are oaths or behavioral tics that help keep mystics in the proper frame of mind while maintaining perfect control over their minds and bodies.</p><p>While these taboos are harmless, they help cast mystics as outsiders. Few feel accepted by society, and fewer still care to become integrated with it.

They claim no mastery over nature.

Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.</p><p>Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"27\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Preserve the Balance</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.</p><p>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.</p><p>Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"28\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Druid</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.</p><p>Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"29\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions.

Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p><p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p><p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"31\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Druids and the Gods</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.</p><p>In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.</p><p>The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","identifier":"druid","levels":6,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"6vytnom37pkazgld","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"wild-shape","type":"number","scale":{"2":{"value":0.25},"4":{"value":0.5},"8":{"value":1}}},"value":{},"title":"Wild Shape CR","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"vhb12cmfail0vp30","type":"ItemGrant","level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"icons/creatures/mammals/elk-moose-marked-green.webp","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{"added":{"NTTu2cFjhngVP0qc":"","eSJ9p7WPHpnvSf0p":""}}},{"_id":"0p8uobkk4mqp63it","type":"ItemGrant","level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"icons/creatures/mammals/elk-moose-marked-green.webp","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{"added":{"p5elI41jhMbHZcwu":"","P3Mt0ue8ntM5Onj3":""}}},{"_id":"i5yxkivpyl0a1s4m","type":"ItemGrant","level":4,"title":"Features","icon":"icons/creatures/mammals/elk-moose-marked-green.webp","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{"added":{"7zEIeUHgVO94Broo":"","FPCaaYdPvdbuEVzy":""}}}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ani","arc","ins","med","nat","prc","rel","sur"],"value":["nat","prc"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"}},"ownership":{"default":0,"cvsSJX6vcoBwcF3Q":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"DOJ9hfYohn39oq5i","name":"Circle of the Land","type":"subclass","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/tree-oak.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"srd5e":{"page":"classes.html","source":"PHB","hash":"druid_phb","sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"druid_phb,state:sub-land-phb=b1","propDroppable":"subclass","filterValues":{"Source":{"TCE":1,"ERLW":1,"UA2020SubclassesPt3":0,"UAArtificerRevisited":0,"UAClassFeatureVariants":0,"UAArtificer":0,"PHB":1,"XGE":1,"UABarbarianPrimalPaths":0,"UARevisedSubclasses":0,"SCAG":1,"UA2020SubclassesPt1":0,"UA2022GiantOptions":0,"UABarbarianAndMonk":0,"GHPG":1,"UA2020SubclassesPt2":0,"UABardAndPaladin":0,"UABardBardColleges":0,"UAKitsOfOld":0,"VRGR":1,"UA2020SubclassesPt4":0,"UATheRangerRevised":0,"UA2021MagesOfStrixhaven":0,"PSA":0,"UAModernMagic":0,"DMG":1,"UA2022WondersOfTheMultiverse":0,"UAClericDivineDomains":0,"GGR":1,"UAOrderDomain":0,"UAClericDruidWizard":0,"UADruid":0,"UAThreeSubclasses":0,"UARevisedClassOptions":0,"UASidekicks":0,"UALightDarkUnderdark":0,"UAWaterborneAdventures":0,"UAFighter":0,"EGW":1,"UAGothicHeroes":0,"UA2020PsionicOptionsRevisited":0,"UAFighterRogueWizard":0,"UAFighterRangerRogue":0,"FTD":1,"UA2020SubclassesPt5":0,"UAATrioOfSubclasses":0,"UAMonk":0,"UATheMysticClass":0,"UAPaladin":0,"MOT":1,"UAPrestigeClassesRunMagic":0,"UARangerAndRogue":0,"UARanger":0,"UAModifyingClasses":0,"UA2020SubclassesRevisited":0,"UASorcererAndWarlock":0,"UASorcerer":0,"UAGiantSoulSorcerer":0,"UA2022HeroesOfKrynn":0,"PSK":0,"UAWarlockAndWizard":0,"UATheFaithful":0,"UAEberron":0,"UAWizardRevisited":0,"_isActive":true,"_totals":{"yes":12,"no":0,"ignored":52},"_combineBlue":"or","_combineRed":"or"},"Miscellaneous":{"Reprinted":2,"Sidekick":2,"SRD":0,"Basic Rules":0,"_isActive":true,"_totals":{"yes":0,"no":2,"ignored":2},"_combineBlue":"or","_combineRed":"or"},"Other/Text Options":{"isDisplayClassIfSubclassActive":false,"isClassFeatureVariant":true,"_isActive":false}},"isPrimaryClass":true,"isDirectImport":true},"scene-packer":{"hash":"8ae03f163dbd0f25bbc0accb2b740cc172888f3e"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<div class=\"mb-2 ve-flex-col\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition.

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked @condition[unconscious].</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as @spell[call lightning], that you've already cast.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as @sense[darkvision], unless your new form also has that sense.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.
